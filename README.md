# The_100_v1.1_3D_Printer

My goal is to greatly improve the documentation for The 100 3D Printer v1.1. This will become my central repository for designs, BOMs, configs, macros, images, troubleshooting guides and much more.

Please feel free to add issues as you see them, and I'll do my best to make improvements as soon as I'm able to.
